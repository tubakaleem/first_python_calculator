🌟 My First Python Calculator

This is my first hand-coded Python project: a simple calculator that can handle sum, subtraction, multiplication, division, and basic trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent).

I built this project as a personal challenge — to see if I could start small, experiment, and complete something entirely on my own. 

(Features)
 1.Sum of multiple numbers
 2.Subtraction of numbers
 3.Multiplication of numbers
4.Division (with division by zero check)
5.Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
6.Input validation with `try / except`
7.Looping until correct input is provided

 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tubakaleem/first_python_calculator.git
   
2. Install dependencies (NumPy):
pip install numpy

3.Run the calculator:
python calculator.py
